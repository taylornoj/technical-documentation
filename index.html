      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
        is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
        its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
        and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
        structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
        example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.</li>
        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
          extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
          provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
          the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="javascript_and_java" </section>
        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
          language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
          most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it
          was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
          system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has
          a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
          provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
          supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
          executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes,
          and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you
          do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly
          typed.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="hello_world" </section>
          <header>Hello World</header>
          <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
            code:</p>
          <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
      greetMe("World");
    </code>
          <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

          <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables" </section>
            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
              With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code> var x = 42.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
            </p>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <code>x = 42.</code>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
              variant.</p>
            <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <code> let y = 13.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="function_declarations" </section>
              <header>Function Declarations</header>
              <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the
                function keyword, followed by:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
              <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
              <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says
                to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
              <code>return number * number;</code>
              <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
                function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally
                or in the calling function.</p>
