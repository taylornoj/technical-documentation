## JavaScript Documentation

Project completed in August 2021 as required to earn the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc05f38939-e562-411d-baff-711683b035f5/responsive-web-design) from [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/).

The objective was to fulfill predetermined user stories and have all tests pass while using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

This project will continue to be updated and personalized in an effort to continue practicing my skills.
